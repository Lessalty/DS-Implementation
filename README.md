Basic Data Structures in C++
This document provides an overview of several fundamental data structures implemented in C++. Each section introduces a specific data structure, discusses its characteristics, and provides a sample implementation. These structures are foundational for understanding more complex algorithms and systems in computer science.

1. ArrayList (Dynamic Array)
A dynamic array that automatically resizes itself as it gets populated beyond its capacity. The array grows its size by a certain factor (commonly 2) whenever additional capacity is needed.

Characteristics:
Random access allows 
𝑂(1)
O(1) time complexity for access operations.
Amortized 
𝑂(1)
O(1) time complexity for insertions at the end.
2. Linked List
A linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It includes singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.

Characteristics:
Singly Linked List: Each node stores a reference to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node stores references to both the next and the previous nodes.
Efficient insertion and deletion operations.
3. Stack
A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. A stack has two principal operations: pushing (adding) an element, which stores an element at the top of the stack, and popping (removing) the top element.

Characteristics:
Provides 
𝑂(1)
O(1) time complexity for insert and delete operations.
Used in scenarios like function call management in programming languages.
4. Queue
A collection that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Characteristics:
Enqueue operation adds an element at the end of the queue.
Dequeue operation removes the element from the beginning of the queue.
Provides 
𝑂(1)
O(1) time complexity for both operations.
5. Binary Tree
A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is a non-linear data structure compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Characteristics:
The depth and balance of the tree can significantly affect the performance of operations.
Used as a base for more specialized structures like Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Heaps, and Balanced Trees.
6. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A type of binary tree where each node has a key greater than all the keys in its left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

Characteristics:
Enables average-case time complexities of 
𝑂(log⁡𝑛)
O(logn) for search, insert, and delete operations.
The structure needs to be balanced to maintain its efficient performance.
7. Hash Map
A data structure that maps keys to values, designed to optimize the speed of data retrieval operations.

Characteristics:
Implements an array of buckets and uses hash functions to distribute keys among these buckets.
Handles collisions using methods like chaining (linked lists) or open addressing.
Implementations
Each of these data structures is implemented in C++, with emphasis on learning how to manipulate these structures. The implementations are straightforward to focus on teaching the underlying concepts rather than achieving optimal performance.

This README should serve as a starting point for those new to computer science or those looking to understand the basic operations of these fundamental data structures.
