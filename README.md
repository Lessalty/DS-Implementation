# README: Fundamental Data Structures in C++

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to fundamental data structures, implemented in C++. Each section provides an introduction to a specific data structure, detailing its properties, operations, and a sample C++ implementation. These structures are crucial for building a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering.

## 1. **Dynamic Array (ArrayList)**
A dynamic array automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added, allowing it to handle more data than its initial capacity.

### Characteristics:
- **Direct Access**: Provides \(O(1)\) time complexity for accessing elements.
- **Amortized Expansion**: Automatically resizes, typically doubling its capacity, which provides amortized \(O(1)\) for additions at the end.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Uses a single contiguous block of memory.
- Resizes when capacity is exceeded during element addition.

## 2. **Linked Lists**
A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node stores its own data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It's a flexible structure, as elements can be easily added or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.

### Characteristics:
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Each node has a single link field pointing to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Each node has two links, one to the next node and one to the previous, allowing bidirectional traversal.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Efficient insertion and deletion.
- No indices for direct access, which can lead to slower searches.

## 3. **Stack**
A stack is a linear data structure which follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle where elements are added and removed from the same end.

### Characteristics:
- **LIFO Order**: The last element added is the first one to be removed.
- **Access Top Element**: Only the top element is accessible at any given time.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Used in scenarios like depth-first search in graph algorithms, expression evaluation, and syntax parsing.

## 4. **Queue**
A queue is a linear structure which follows a FIFO (First In First Out) method, where elements are added at one end and removed from the other.

### Characteristics:
- **FIFO Order**: The first element added will be the first element to be removed.
- **Access Front Element**: Only the front element can be accessed.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Useful in breadth-first search, caching mechanisms, and IO buffers.

## 5. **Binary Tree**
A binary tree is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes, each node containing up to two children referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Characteristics:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Each node can have zero, one, or two children.
- **Varieties**: Includes specialized forms like Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL trees, and Red-Black trees.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Used to implement efficient searching and sorting algorithms.
- Provides a basis for more complex data structures like heaps and graphs.

## 6. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where each node has a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in the right subtree.

### Characteristics:
- **Ordered Structure**: Facilitates fast search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Efficient Operations**: Average-case complexity for search, insert, and delete is \(O(\log n)\).

### Implementation Highlights:
- Must be kept balanced to maintain \(O(\log n)\) search time.
- Used in databases to maintain dynamic datasets.

## 7. **Hash Map**
A hash map offers a means of implementing associative arrays, a structure that can map keys to values using a hash function to compute the index for each key.

### Characteristics:
- **Fast Access**: Aims for \(O(1)\) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- **Handling Collisions**: Collisions are managed using techniques like chaining or open addressing.

### Implementation Highlights:
- Highly efficient for scenarios requiring rapid access to elements.
- Integral to the performance of database indexing, caching systems, and associative arrays.
